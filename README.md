## Features

- **Historical Data:** Makes predictions using monthly gold prices from 2020 onwards.
- **LSTM Model:** Utilizes deep learning techniques to predict the future trend of gold prices.
- **Visualization:** Provides visual comparisons between predicted results and actual prices.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow (or Keras)
